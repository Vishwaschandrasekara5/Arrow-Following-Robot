To run your project using the provided Python scripts, you'll need to ensure that all necessary libraries are installed on your Raspberry Pi and that you're following the correct steps to execute each script. Here's a guide on how to install the required libraries and run the scripts.

### 1. **Install Required Libraries**

You'll need to install several Python libraries, including `pigpio`, `RPi.GPIO`, and `opencv-python`. Here's how you can do that:

#### **Step 1: Update and Upgrade**
Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

#### **Step 2: Install `pigpio`**
`pigpio` is required to control the servos. Install it using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install pigpio python3-pigpio
```

Start the `pigpio` daemon:

```bash
sudo pigpiod
```

#### **Step 3: Install `RPi.GPIO`**
`RPi.GPIO` is required to control the GPIO pins for motor control:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio
```

#### **Step 4: Install OpenCV**
OpenCV is used for image processing, including color detection:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
```

Alternatively, you can install it via `pip`:

```bash
pip3 install opencv-python-headless
```

#### **Step 5: Install `numpy`**
`numpy` is used for array manipulation in image processing:

```bash
pip3 install numpy
```

### 2. **Running the Scripts**

Hereâ€™s how you can run the different scripts you've provided:

#### **Run `servo_mortor.py`**

1. Make sure the `pigpio` daemon is running:

   ```bash
   sudo pigpiod
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   sudo python3 /path/to/servo_mortor.py
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path where your script is saved.

#### **Run `line_following.py`**

1. Ensure your motor driver and IR sensors are correctly connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   sudo python3 /path/to/line_following.py
   ```

#### **Run `Colour_detection.py`**

1. Ensure your camera is connected and functional.

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   sudo python3 /path/to/Colour_detection.py
   ```

### 3. **Troubleshooting**

- **Permissions Issues:** If you encounter permission errors, ensure you're using `sudo` to run the scripts.
  
- **Camera Issues:** Ensure no other application is using the camera when you run your color detection script. You can check what's using the camera with:

  ```bash
  sudo lsof /dev/video0
  ```

  If something is using it, stop the process or reboot your Raspberry Pi.

- **Pigpio Errors:** If you receive errors related to `pigpio`, ensure the daemon is running with `sudo pigpiod`.

### 4. **Summary of Commands**

Here's a summary of the terminal commands to run:

```bash
# Update and upgrade your system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install required libraries
sudo apt-get install pigpio python3-pigpio python3-rpi.gpio python3-opencv
pip3 install numpy

# Start pigpio daemon
sudo pigpiod

# Run the scripts
sudo python3 /path/to/servo_mortor.py
sudo python3 /path/to/line_following.py
sudo python3 /path/to/Colour_detection.py
```

By following these steps, you should be able to run your project successfully.
